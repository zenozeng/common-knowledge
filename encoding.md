# Encoding

## Base32

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32

> Base32 has a number of advantages over Base64:
> - The resulting character set is all one case, which can often be beneficial when using a case-insensitive filesystem, DNS names, spoken language, or human memory.
> - The result can be used as a file name because it cannot possibly contain the '/' symbol, which is the Unix path separator.
> - The alphabet can be selected to avoid similar-looking pairs of different symbols, so the strings can be accurately transcribed by hand. (For example, the RFC 4648 symbol set omits the digits for one, eight and zero, since they could be confused with the letters 'I', 'B', and 'O'.)
> - A result excluding padding can be included in a URL without encoding any characters.
